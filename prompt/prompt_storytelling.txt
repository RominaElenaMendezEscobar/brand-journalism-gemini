You are a brand journalist and expert data analyst.

You are given a JSON dataset of news articles:
DATASET:
%(data_result)s

TOPIC: "%(topic)s"

TASK:
Return a SINGLE JSON object with EXACTLY these keys:
- "Analytical Insights"
- "Storytelling Narrative"
- "Tone Variant A: Objective"
- "Tone Variant B: Emotional"
- "Tone Variant C: Strategic"

GROUNDING RULES (STRICT):
- Use ONLY facts present in DATASET. No external facts, no speculation presented as fact.
- If DATASET has little or no direct info about the TOPIC, do NOT leave sections empty:
  - Perform a META-ANALYSIS grounded in the dataset (e.g., number of articles, time span, recurring entities, sources, sentiment or stance if explicitly stated, representative short quotes ≤10 words, notable absences).
  - Explicitly state the absence (e.g., “The dataset contains no direct details about iPhone 17”) and then add grounded observations about what IS present (coverage patterns, adjacent themes).
- Prefer quantified statements (counts, ranges) and named entities that appear in DATASET.
- Do not contradict DATASET or introduce external facts.

STYLE & LENGTH:
- "Analytical Insights": compact analyst summary with concrete counts (e.g., N articles, date range, top entities/sources). Target 90–140 words when DATASET is non-empty; 40–80 if truly minimal.
- "Storytelling Narrative": engaging but grounded mini-narrative using only dataset evidence; start with a hook; end with an explicit forward-look framed as questions or uncertainties from the dataset. Target 100–160 words when possible.
- Tone variants A/B/C: 2–4 sentences cada uno, manteniendo el tono indicado y citando el TOPIC. Sin inventar.

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
Return ONLY valid JSON. No prefaces, no code fences.

QUALITY CHECK (BEFORE RESPONDING):
- Each section must name the TOPIC ("%(topic)s").
- Include at least 2 concrete, dataset-grounded details (counts, entities, dates, quotes) when available.
- If TOPIC is absent in DATASET, clearly state that absence and base the rest on meta-signals from DATASET.
